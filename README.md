# Natural-disaster-prediction-earthquake

IDEA:
In India, one of the major natural disasters comprise of Earthquake, which has a major toll on life of a large number of people - economically, mentally as well as physically. Most of this can be avoided/ dealt with via appropriate preparation through timely alerts and warnings.
The project aims at developing a probabilistic system to predict this calamity and considering scores of prediction from an ensemble of machine learning algorithms (such as Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, etc). Training such algorithms on past records of seismic activities, rainfall records, soil quality records, previous calamity history, such disasters will be predicted for a particular region.
Bonus- If time permits, this idea will also explore generating alerts thereby effectively helping people take proper precautions in due time.
